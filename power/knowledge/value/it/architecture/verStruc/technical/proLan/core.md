	- query (SQL, graphQL), document (HTML, CSS), data storage & exchange (XML, YAML)
- property
	- paradigm
		- imperative (statements)
			- procedural
			- object-oriented
		- declarative (expressions), abstraction
			- logical
			- functional
	- dynamic, weakly - static, strongly typed
	- memory mgmt & concurrency -> pointers vs referencess, pass by address
		- reference counting: interval 
		- ARC: RC but automatically
		- resource acquisition is initialization: object's lifetime
		- ownership + RAII: its owner's scope
	- data type & variables
		- primitives + complex
		- declarators + scope + hoisting
- implementation: ahead-of-time/ just-in-time compiled (one language to another), interpreted: performance, portability, development speed
