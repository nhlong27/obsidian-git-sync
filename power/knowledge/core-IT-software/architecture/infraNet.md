- internet - interconnected (vs connected) networks of computers -> data sharing
- www - system built on top of internet, uses standardized protocols (http, html), browsers, hypertext documents, multi-media -> sharing & navigating more efficiently (web-like manner, indexed)

	- physical (devices - bits)
	- data link (src, des MAC/ethernet address - frames)
	- network (routes (src, des ip addresses) - packets)
	- transport (e2e com - segments (src, des port, sequence no, tcp err checking - checksum))
		- server/client creates socket and binds it to a port for sending/listening to incoming request/response https://qr.ae/pK2Deg
		- DNS lookup - upd, os https://serverfault.com/questions/643506/how-does-the-http-get-method-work-in-relation-to-dns-protocol
	- application
		- platform
			- web: Ajax - approach how use technologies (html, xml, json, xmlhttprequest obj - browser given library to send http req/res), promise utilizes webapi + callback
			- mobile: threads/coroutines + http libraries
		- data format https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54122999/is-json-a-string
			- raw/encoded string: html, csv, xml, json - serialization
			- binary (array buffers) -> protocol buffers
			- blobs
		- protocols
			- application: streaming ingest -> transcode -> delivery https://www.wowza.com/blog/streaming-protocols#streaming-protocol, https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwjda4/comment/ir70vma/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
				- rtmp (flash), rtsp (ip camera) (control protocol)  (not supported in many players) --> transcode into http-based
				- http adaptive streaming (hls, dash) -- bitrate Mbps
				- srt, webrtc
			- http/s: header (request line, optional request headers) + body
				- accept-language
				- TCP handshake (syn, syn-ack, ack) - certificate check SSL/TLS (certificate is signature signed by private keys of certificate authorities, browsers store public keys -> server return TLS version, cipher suite) - key exchange (RSA TLS <=1.2, DH  TSL 1.3)

					- cryptography
						- symmetric
							- DES (64 bits), AES (128, 192, 256 bits)
						- asymmetric
							- RSA
							- signature DSA
						- Diffie-Hellman key exchange
			- websockets
	- api
		- rest (http) - resources
		- rpc (http) - actions --> grpc (http/2 + protocol buffers) microservices, mobile? browsers doesn't allow control over http/2 primitives
		- graphql (http) - single url to engine point
		- tRPC - '*simpler REST*', a single API endpoint that operates behind your api engine
		- openAPI/swagger - specification for building api https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/api-management/understanding-grpc-openapi-and-rest-and-when-to-use-them
	- patterns/techniques
		- server-sent event
		- polling
			- long polling
			- short polling
		- webhook
- infra
	-  responsibility
		- monolithic
		- modular (microservices, microkernel)
	- communication
		- request-response
		- event-driven
