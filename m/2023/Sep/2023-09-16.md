								- multi paradigm, dynamic - weakly typed
								- variables (var, let, const), hoisting, scope -> closure, this,  
									- data types: primitives - immutable + objects - mutable
										- class vs object
										- normal vs arrow function
									- callback -> promise -> async/await
							- low-level vs high-level - data processing, cpu intensive
								- performance -> implementation - interpretation, type checking (no optimization here), memory overhead (might be because of dynamic typing) 
								- hoisting (javascript)
							- garbage collection - heap
								- process, threads - units of execution, isolation vs efficiency
									- threads - program counters, registers, stack
									- process - threads + heap
									- concurrency 
										- context switching (process/thread context) - PCB, faster with threads than with processes (same address space, no memory page switch)
										- coroutine - (code context) non-blocking code
									- parallelism - multiple cores
