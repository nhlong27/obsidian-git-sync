To protect API
>1.  Use API keys: Generate unique API keys for each client and validate those keys with every API request. Only authorized clients with valid API keys will be able to access the API.  
2.  Use HTTPS: Encrypt all API requests and responses using HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
3.  Limit access: Limit the amount of data that each client can access by implementing rate limiting and access controls.
4.  Use authentication tokens: Implement token-based authentication to ensure that clients have permission to access the API. Tokens can be generated for specific users or roles, and can expire after a certain period of time.
5.  Obfuscate code: Minimize the chances of reverse-engineering your API by obfuscating your code. This can make it more difficult for clients to understand how your API works and how to access it.****
