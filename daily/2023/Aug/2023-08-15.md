	- ecommerce
		- goal
			- interested in how ecommerce site architecture works (headless cms) -> Wanted to build own order, stock services, only payment depends on Saas like Stripe checkout and webhook. As for data, scrapes websites like pepsico, but the data changes often so set up a cron job push to kafka topics, and consumes in a service that updates data in mongodb
			- try Nextjs with TS also a server-side frameworks -> next api routes with Next auth. Also want to use graphql for CRUD. PostgreSQL for storing users, orders, cart items that have strong relationships and MongoDB for products because query faster. Also a Redis cache layer to query products only (because products don't change much, not have to deal with cache invalidation). For client use Redux for state management and Shadcn styled component library. Also unit test, integration test. Also use docker and attempt at terraform and ansible for setting up AWS EC2 instance.
		- state-now
			- architecture
				- client: Next/TS + Tailwind (shadcn), Redux
				- server: JWT-based Next-Auth, Next api + graphql (zod), prisma/PostgreSQL, mongoose/MongoDB, Redis, Kafka pub/sub service + cron job
				- service: Stripe checkout, webhook
			- pipeline
				- deploy: Vercel, Railway.app, S3
		- [ ] state-final
			- architecture
				- client: 
					- [x] Redux
					- [x] Next Ssr  - front page ssg, catalogue ssr, every other page csr
					- [x] cron(demo accounts, doc) 
					- light house (Contentful Paint (LCP), First Input Delay (FID), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) + @vercel/analytics)
			- pipeline
				- test: unit test, integration test
		- Bonus:
			- architecture
				- server: Elastic Search, 
					- migrate to upstash
				- service: Cloudinary
			- pipeline
				- deploy: client to EC2, kafka to EC2
	- dengue-defense
		- goal 
			- refactored from thesis project, interested in building an application integrated with IoT devices to help combat dengue. How pub/sub works and when to use it
