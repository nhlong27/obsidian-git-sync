	- concurrency, garbage collection (heap), typed
	- data type & variables
		- primitives + complex
		- declarators + scope + hoisting
- implementation: ahead-of-time/ just-in-time compiled (one language to another), interpreted: performance, portability, development speed

- types
	- rust 
		- multi-paradigm, static/strongly typed, manual memory management, multi-threaded
		- c, c++ - memory management, security
	- go 
		- multi-paradigm, static/strongly typed, garbage collection, multi-threaded
		- java, c#, c++ - concurrency, simplicity
	- objective-c
	- javascript 
		- multi-paradigm, dynamic/weakly typed, garbage collection, single-threaded non-blocking
		- data types & variables
	- java 
		- oop -> kotlin, static/strongly typed, garbage collection, , multi-threaded
		- c, c++ - oop 
			- runs on VM -> platform independence, easy to scale
			- inertia, rich standard library
			- garbage collection, no manual memory management 
		- data types & variables
			- byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean, char - String, Array, Class
	- swift
		- multi, static/strongly typed, ARC, multi-threaded
		- data types & variables
			- var, let - Int, UInt, Double, Float, Bool, Character, String, Tuple, Optional, Array, Dictionary, Set - Class
