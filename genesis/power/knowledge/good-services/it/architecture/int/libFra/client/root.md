- react
	- state
		- React batches state updates (event handlers, lifecycle methods, and non-React-controlled: promises, setTimeout)
		- state should be as local as possible (also with React Context, not with Redux or Jotai)
		- setState tells React to render  based on value (primitive) or reference change
		- becareful with State depending on other state -> use derived value instead https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tz0fDABt67g&t=327s
		- useState [state, setState] -> state references the state, setState tells React to rerender with new object (keeps state immutable), state references new object at next rerender. setState(prev=>) prev references the actual state (meanwhile  state may only reference the old state object )
		- decide to useState (controlled input) or useRef (uncontrolled input) based on use-case https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZqMVUEiDIw
		- state as component in React rendering https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vXJkeZf-4-4 --> key
