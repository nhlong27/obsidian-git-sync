	- language - javascript
		- ajax (callbacks). 3 ways: browser as terminal (php), dom manipulation (jquery), html/js abstraction with callback - promise - async/await 
	- libFra
		- react - simply a library (doesn't need node to run)
			- goal: 
				- component-based and declarative UI
					- jsx component (object, function-based syntax)
					- ![[Pasted image 20230807083837.png]]
					- ![[Pasted image 20230807085430.png]]
				- efficient DOM manipulation, performance optimization
					- DOM <- updates - VDOM reconciliation (diffing algo) + keys + batch updates
				- consistency
					- unidirectional data flow, one-way data binding (state -> ui/model->view). E.g. uncontrolled (dom state) vs controlled component (react *parent* component internal state) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32712605/is-reacts-data-binding-really-one-way-it-seems-like-it-is-two-way
		- next
			- goal
				- react component-based architecture + spa reactivity + document era ssr (SEO)
					- build time: generate static html, code splitting, ... getStaticProps
					- run time: Link client side routing, fetch html or getServerProps
					- ![[Pasted image 20230902105909.png]] (for every page)
			- properties

				- CSR
					- Suspense (react-query-isLoading or state) + ErrorBoundary ((react-query-error or try/catch + setState or componentDidCatch) + moving up the ancestry)
				- SSR
					- cannot use Suspense & ErrorBoundary because no state 
					- moving error handling to server (try/catch)
					- keep suspense handling on client (for a whole page where ssr occurs)
