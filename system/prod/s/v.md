				- firmedia
					- goal 
						- interested in how to build a movie site, how server and crud work, how auth works with jwt
						- try vite, full ts, experimenting with state management libs like jotai, zustand, deploy on the web

						- pipeline
							- deploy: onrender, railway.app
				- dengue-defense
					- goal 
						- refactored from thesis project, interested in building an application integrated with IoT devices to help combat dengue. How pub/sub works and when to use it
						- how trpc and type-safe api work, try session based auth. Implement polling to kafka and save telemetries to time series database. Deploy to ec2 instance
					- state
						- architecture
							- client: next/ts, tailwind (shadcn, recharts), jotai
							- server: session-based next-auth, trpc (zod), prisma/postgresql + timeseries, kafka pub/sub
						- pipeline
							- deploy: vercel, supabase
				- ecommerce
					- goal
						- interested in how ecommerce site architecture works, use saas like stripe checkout and webhook. As for data, scrapes websites like pepsico, but the data changes often so set up a cron job push to kafka topics, and consumes in a service that updates data in mongodb
						- try next api routes with next auth, graphql for crud. postgresql for storing users, orders, cart items that have strong relationships and mongodb for products because query faster. Also a redis cache layer to query products only (because products don't change much, not have to deal with cache invalidation). For client use redux for state management
