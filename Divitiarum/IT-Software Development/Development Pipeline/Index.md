The development pipeline of a web application generally follows the following steps:

>1.  Requirements Gathering: The first step is to understand the requirements of the web application. This involves meeting with stakeholders to determine what the application needs to accomplish, who the target users are, and what features the application should have.
>2.  Design: Once the requirements are understood, the next step is to design the application. This involves creating wireframes, mockups, and prototypes of the application's interface and user experience.
    3.  Development: After the design is complete, the development process begins. This involves writing the code for the application, integrating third-party APIs and services, and setting up the back-end infrastructure.
    4.  Testing: Once the application is developed, it needs to be tested to ensure that it is functioning as intended. This includes unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing.
    5.  Deployment: Once the application has been tested and is ready for production, it needs to be deployed to a production environment. This involves setting up the necessary infrastructure and configuration to run the application in a live environment.
    6.  Maintenance: After the application is deployed, it needs to be maintained and updated over time. This includes fixing bugs, adding new features, and ensuring that the application is running smoothly and securely.

The mandatory environments for software development depend on the specific project and its requirements. However, there are some environments that are typically considered essential for most software development projects:

>1.  Development Environment: The development environment is where developers write, test, and debug code. This environment is essential for developing and testing the software before it is deployed to production.
    2.  Staging Environment: The staging environment is a replica of the production environment that is used for testing and quality assurance. This environment allows developers to test the software in a controlled environment before deploying it to the production environment.
    3.  Production Environment: The production environment is the live environment where the software is deployed and made available to users. This environment is essential for ensuring that the software is accessible to users and meets the desired quality standards.
    

### Staging environment
- Mirror the production environment
	- Test functionality, performance, compatibility and security
	- User acceptance testing

### Deploying
