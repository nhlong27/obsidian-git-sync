**The Facade, Proxy, Adapter pattern**
**Production environment**
**Abstraction vs Coupling**

***React***
helper methods/functions
naming 'polymorphic' props: styles, "flags"(boolean), role, function
When to use type predicates

**Language Mastery**
**The basics of all languages**
- ==Data structuration (variables, types) ==
|  complex structures (functions) . procedural --> OOP  
v
- ==Data manipulations (operations, control flow)==
**Paradigms**
	imperative - instruct *how* to change states
		procedural
		object-oriented
	declarative - instruct *how* to change states by predefined logic, or *what* logic to use
		logical
		functional

We manipulate data to achieve a goal/change states -> We reach that goal/change states through operations/algorithms
One of the core manipulation patterns is 
	CRUD, Index, Search, Aggregate, Join (with data persistence)
	Real-time stream processing
	Machine learning tasks?
	Graphics related
![[Pasted image 20230416085253.png]]

OOP
	Encapsulation of data + logic in a data structure/object
	Abstract
	Hierarchy
	Polymorphism

*Javascript*
***Types***
	Primitives: null (typeof === object), undefined, string, symbol, bigint, number, boolean
		Immutable
		Pass by value
	Objects: built-ins (.prototypes) (root: Object.prototype), constructors for built-ins (root: Function.prototype)  --- The purpose of prototype + constructors is to imitate OOP class
		Mutable
		Pass by reference
Type coercion
	no-coercion with === , !== 
	Between primitives
		"5" + 3 -> string // "53" 
		"5" * 3 -> number  // 15
		"5" == 5 -> number // true
	Between objects with primitives

The concept of 'first-class' objects
Why we don't use global state in Javascript
Regex global modifier
Array.slice -> shallow copy

Buffer - area of storage in memory that holds data until the the program is ready, buffer overflow
```
const buffer = Buffer.from('Hello, world!', 'utf8');
console.log(buffer); // Output: <Buffer 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 77 6f 72 6c 64 21>
console.log(buffer.toString('hex')); // Output: 48656c6c6f2c20776f726c6421

```
Machine code - hex and binary, Assembly code are platform-specific
Java compiler -> bytecode (independt of platforms) with JVM
Hardware platforms vs Operating systems
Python interpreter -> bytecode -> Python virtual machine
Garbage collecting
```
const obj = new Map([['key', 1], ['value',1]])
for (let [k, v] of obj){
  console.log(k, v)
}
```

***Data structures***
String
Array
Linked list
Stack 
Queue
Class
Tree 
Heap
Graph




**TypeScript**
Narrowing (union) - typeof, in, instanceof, as, type predicates (is)

Utility types
Generics
Function overloads

**Algorithms**
BigO: 1, logN, N, NlogN, N^2, 2^N, N!, ...
