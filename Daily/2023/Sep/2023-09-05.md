						- hardWare
						- proLan
							- lan
								- low-level vs high-level - data processing, cpu intensive
									- performance -> implementation - interpretation, type checking (no optimization here), memory overhead (might be because of dynamic typing) 
									- hoisting (javascript)
									- garbage collection - heap
								- process, threads - units of execution, isolation vs efficiency
									- threads - program counters, registers, stack
									- process - threads + heap
									- concurrency 
										- context switching (process/thread context) - PCB, faster with threads than with processes (same address space, no memory page switch)
										- coroutine - (code context) non-blocking code
									- parallelism - multiple cores
								- javascript 
									- dynamic/weakly, garbage collection, multi
								- rust 
									- static/strongly, manual memory management, multi
									- c, c++ - memory management, security
								- go 
									- static/strongly, garbage collection, multi
									- java, c#, c++ - concurrency, simplicity
								- java 
									- static/strongly, garbage collection, oop -> kotlin
									- c, c++ - oop, platform independence

						- infraNet
							- network
								- transport - sockets - communication endpoint
									- tcp - reliable (3 way handshake), unicast
									- udp - fast, unicast, multicast, broadcast
										- rtp - transmit (session & presentation layer)
								- application: streaming ingest -> transcode -> delivery https://www.wowza.com/blog/streaming-protocols#streaming-protocol
									- rtmp (flash), rtsp (ip camera) (control protocol)  (not supported in many players) --> transcode into http-based
									- http adaptive streaming (hls, dash) -- bitrate Mbps
									- srt, webrtc
