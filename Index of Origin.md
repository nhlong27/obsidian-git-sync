### Why exist these sections?
It's more beneficial to abstraction(s) that serve specific purposes, without losing the bigger picture for later need of analysis.
*e.g. Productivity System is technically closer to the shared parent or root of all sections and itself.*
Reason: 
	Goal == progress of states over time
	State == data/abstraction(s)
	Abstract on a scale from Adaptability --- Colocation (Rule?)
