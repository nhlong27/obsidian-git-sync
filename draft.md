it's not that I don't have stories to tell, it's that I don't find them intersting enough to share. More specifically, I don't find it rewarding to share uninteresting stories. Also I think I'm afraid of sharing my own vulnerabilities, scared that they might judge me, or see me in a different light, that would have consequences for my future.

Không phải là tôi không có chuyện để nói, mà là tôi không thấy chúng đủ thú vị để chia sẻ. Cụ thể hơn, tôi không cảm thấy thoả mãn khi chia sẻ những câu chuyện không thú vị. Và tôi nghĩ mình sợ phải chia sẻ những yếu kém của bản thân, sợ rằng người ta sẽ đánh giá mình, sẽ nhìn mình dưới góc nhìn khác, và để lại hậu quả cho tương lai.

Humans have been trying to scare each other through fiction for forever: old stories of ghosts and monsters, horror films, horror video games. There is a wide repertoire of things designed to scare us. Humans have gotten really good at it too. Despite all the endless trash that seems to come from the horror genre, there are still some real gems out there. But as scary as these creations can be, unfortunately, when it comes to what scares me, what truly keeps me up at night, fiction just can't compete with reality.

What is the worst way to die? You might cite radiation poisoning or some obscure medieval torture, and those would be right to put high on the list. But a far more likely and still considerably unpleasant way to die is drowning. There’s something eerie about drowning. People who drown often do so alone. People who know how to swim may be overconfident in their abilities and are more likely to swim alone or beyond their physical capabilities. Unsupervised children especially are at great risk. It doesn’t even take a large amount of water to drown.

When people who have drowned are pulled out from the water, there are no purposeful signs of maliciousness, even though bodies damaged by passing debris can cause wounds that seem intentional. Drowning is just a simple result of our biology subjected to environments we weren’t built for. Corpses decompose far differently in water than in air. The most well-known change is the wrinkling of skin, but there are also things like discoloration and adipocere (wax buildup). Gases are released during decomposition, which causes bodies to bloat and rise to the surface. The longer a body is not recovered, the more distorted it will become.

While that’s all quite unpleasant, I think the greatest factor to drowning’s perceived eeriness is the tragedy of it all. There’s usually not someone or something to blame directly for the death. It’s more often than not accidental. All it takes is one mishap, one small lapse in judgment, for fatal results. It’s likely you’ve tried to hold your breath underwater just to see how long you could last. First, you feel calm and collected. You might be able to do this for a few minutes. Maybe you use this opportunity to dive deeper into the water. But sooner rather than later, you start to lose energy.

Then the pain starts, that awful squeezing pain. You feel it in your chest and your throat. You start to feel dizzy. Your brain starts screaming at you that you need to ascend, and ascend quickly. Maybe you’ve gone down a bit too far, and you look above and realize that you might be in trouble. You start swimming, you let the last of your air out, and then the panic sets in. It seems you can’t ascend fast enough. You’re literally in too deep. This is it. But if you’re listening to this video right now, it means you made it.

That experience is frightening, yes, but if you’re smart, you never do it in places where there’s serious danger. You’ll either do it around people in a public pool or in a relatively shallow body of water. But in places where someone is really in too deep, in scenarios where someone is truly trapped, I can imagine that the panic you feel while voluntarily holding your breath for a bit too long isn’t even one percent of the terror one feels when they are truly trapped and drowning.

In 2013, a Nigerian tugboat sunk with 12 seamen on board. After it had sunk, the vessel’s cook, Harrison Okene, managed to find an air pocket in the bow of the ship. Through some ingenuity and luck, he managed to survive for three days in a cold, dark room, sustaining himself with a single can of Coke, rapidly running out of air and with the constant threat of the room suddenly filling with water. Eventually, he was miraculously rescued by divers when he reached out for them from his airtight room.

While the story itself is remarkable, I cannot overstate how horrific that experience must have been. Throughout this man’s ordeal, I can only imagine the type of mental anguish he must have felt. Not only was it likely he was going to die either from hypothermia, suffocation, or drowning, he got the rare opportunity to think about dying in those wonderful ways for 60 grueling hours. It’s no wonder he still has nightmares and vowed never to return to the sea. This is a rare incidence of survival, but it makes you wonder if there are any other cases like this where people got trapped in an air pocket but didn’t get rescued. But how would we be able to know? I mean, we can guess with probabilities and things like that, but how can we truly know about any scenarios like this if we never eventually rescue them and hear their story, right?

When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, they destroyed or damaged 19 ships. One of those ships was the USS West Virginia, which was struck by torpedoes seven times and sunk. As the ship began to list, prompt damage control efforts initiated by Lieutenant John S. Harper saved it from capsizing. This was done by closing all the hatch compartments and counterflooding the starboard side of the ship. These actions undoubtedly saved hundreds of lives.

The USS West Virginia burned for 30 hours. When the fires were extinguished on December 8th and things quieted down, a noise could be heard. There was a faint banging noise that, among the chaos, could have easily been mistaken for a piece of loose rigging slapping against the hull. It soon dawned on shipmates near the scene that men were trapped 40 feet down in a closed, airtight storeroom in the bow of the ship. Unfortunately, any rescue efforts were nearly impossible. Cutting a hole would rapidly flood the room, and using a torch would ignite trapped gases, causing an explosion.

These sailors, who were eventually revealed to be Ronald Endicott, Clifford Olds, and Lewis Costin, were truly trapped. When the West Virginia was eventually salvaged six months later by pumping out enough water for it to partially float, the three bodies were found in the small compartment. However, this scene was unlike most. Flashlight batteries and empty ration cans littered the floor. But on the wall was the most haunting discovery: a calendar covered in red Xs, starting from December 7th and ending on December 23rd. These three men had sat trapped underwater in the bow of the ship, slowly dying for 16 days.

The Navy told the parents of the men that they had died on December 7th. But after the discovery, only some of the family members ever found out. The information was purposefully withheld by some relatives to spare them the grief. As of this video, all their headstones say they died December 7th. It’s hard to imagine the anguish those men must have felt for that length of time. It was also difficult for the men on guard duty to hear the banging noise day after day, knowing nothing could be done.

The level of suffering those men must have experienced is quite unthinkable. Not only were they truly trapped like Okene, once the thought crossed their minds that they might not be rescued, they must have experienced psychological torture on a level I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemies. Not only were they going to die, they apparently got to think about dying in that small, dark hole underwater for more than two weeks.

What is the worst way to die? Well, I would certainly put that high on the list. It’s stories like this that make you wonder why thalassophobia isn’t more common. Thalassophobia is an intense and persistent fear of the sea. This can include the fear of deep bodies of water, the vastness of the sea, sea creatures, and distance from land. This is different from aquaphobia, which is a fear of water itself. Drowning, getting stranded, or getting trapped underwater in the vast, hostile environment of the sea are some of the many good reasons to fear it.

While it wasn’t the sea itself that killed those three men, the sea certainly aided in their entrapment. I don’t believe I have thalassophobia. While on occasion I do fear being stranded in the middle of the ocean, being attacked by a monstrous sea creature while swimming, or somehow being sucked down to the bottom of the sea floor, these feelings are neither intense nor persistent. Less intense when I’m on land and more so when I’m swimming in the ocean. Understandably, if you got me thinking about it for a while, I might get pretty anxious. But my rational thinking is simply too overpowering for me to truly start to panic over those things.

I will likely never work on a battleship. I doubt I’m going to pursue marine biology and get the opportunity to be in a submersible. The likelihood of getting swallowed by an enormous sea creature is slim, to say the least. While the ocean is just a few hours from where I live, when I swam in it, my thoughts of danger are usually overpowered by the fact that, hey, playing in relatively shallow water is fun. But that fear is still there. It lingers in the back of my ape brain, occasionally revealing itself anytime I see a particularly eerie deep water photo.

Don’t get me wrong, if you tried to put me in one of those submarines with the big glass domes that descend into the ocean a mile or two, you’d better believe you’d get a fight from me. But is that because I fear the ocean, or more because I fear being crammed into a tiny vessel and descending into complete darkness where I face the possibility of the vessel and, subsequently, my own body being crushed like a soda can?

My relationship with the ocean in general is equal parts fascination and fear. Fear of the vast emptiness, the otherworldly environment, and fascination with those same things. I haven
